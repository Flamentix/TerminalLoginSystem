# TerminalLoginSystem


- Important guide (for idiots):
  - Don't remove any of the temp users in the login.py folder. Won't function properly.
  - Try not to mess with the 'write' function in login.py either. Poor idea as it can append null bytes to the code ;(
  - Don't add '}' to your password. I made it so that you can't but don't overwrite it. Don't ask why.
